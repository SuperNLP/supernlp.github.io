title: EMNLP 2018 Thoughts and Notes
---

This year’s EMNLP was bigger than any ACL conference ever before. With around 2500 attendees, a couple of hundred talks, and a few hundred posters, it was unthinkable to try and keep track of everything. Nevertheless, in this day-after-the-conference blog, bubbling over with ideas, we will do just that. Starting from the first workshop and concluding with Johan Bos’ _Moment of Meaning_, we will attempt to offer a convincing account of what happened in Brussels and what it meant for the future of NLP.

# Sequence Classification with Human Attention

_Full disclosure:_ this paper comes from our own group, so we might be a little biased here. Speaking of which, a recent theme in the field has been the call for more inductive bias and ways to introduce it. In this paper, the authors connect dots from previous work in our group by combining techniques known from multi-task learning with signals of human language processing. In particular, they use a bidirectional RNN with attention for sequence classification. So far so good, but the interesting part is that the network’s attention mechanism is enticed to more closely model human attention as attested by gaze patterns recorded in eye-tracking experiments. This is achieved through an auxiliary loss which, notably, can be minimized from external gaze data, such that no eye-tracking recordings are needed at test time. The paper shows that across three sentence classification tasks, biasing the machine attention towards human attention leads to consistent performance gains and results in sensible attention patterns that both validate the approach and help analyzing system decisions.
